They're not actually email, but pretend that they are, they are often very oddly formatted, and are difficult to use. Worst of all, they don't save your work. Therefore, if you wish to email me, please click on the envelope above, or use <b><a href="mailto:eb@ethanbell.me?Subject=Inquiry%20from%20profile%20website" target="_blank">this link</a></b>. </p> <p> Why do I have a whole section to tell you to click a link? Well, I'd also like to use it to briefly note that email is by far the best way to reach me for new business. I have a phone, the number is on my resume, but it's got spotty service and I don't always get voicemail. Additionally, I honestly just check my email more often. So, long story short, EMAIL ME for any new business. </p> </div> </div>
